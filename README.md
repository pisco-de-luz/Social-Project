# Welcome to the Pisco de Luz Social Project page!

<p>The reality of a historic Quilombola community in the region of Chapada dos Veadeiros in Goiás was the main driver of the project. For generations, residents of the area have had no access to electricity. Living without electricity limits their daily productivity and social interactions. It exposes them to various risks, such as animal attacks and breathing hazardous fumes from diesel oil lamps. These lamps, which they use to illuminate their homes at night, have been the cause of several household fires in which families have lost everything they had.</p>

<p>In July of 2017, André had his first experience spending a night using only diesel oil lamps. Close to 8 o'clock in the night, he remembers that the smoke from diesel burning had already made the environment unbearable. The impression was of being in a closed garage with the car running. The next day, your nostrils dawned full of soot.</p>
<p>Confronted with this scenario, André developed a low-cost solar-powered lighting system to install in their homes. The solar kits consist of wires, LED lamps, a solar panel, and an intelligent controller using an Arduino Nano.</p>

<p>The system also allows monitoring of many variables like how many hours of illumination were used, solar radiation per day, the minimum and maximum voltage of the battery, etc. Everything through the serial port.</p>

Pisco de Luz assembles and installs solar-powered light kits in low-income communities with the help of volunteers.

# Bringing Dignity

We transform the lives of families who still live without access to electricity. 

# How?

We install a small solar panel on the roof, an intelligent circuit, a battery, various lights, and light switches throughout the homes.
