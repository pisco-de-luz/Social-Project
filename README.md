# Welcome to the Pisco de Luz Social Project page!

## Why and how this project started
<p>Imagine total darkness. Most of us can’t. We have lived in a world where power runs through everything - our devices, homes, and lives. However, for generations, residents of a Quilombola community in the region of Chapada dos Veadeiros had no access to electricity, condemning them to live in debilitating darkness every night. Living without power severely limits their productivity as well as social interactions.</p>

<p>It also exposes them to life-threatening risks, such as animal attacks and hazardous fumes from diesel oil lamps. These lamps, which they use to illuminate their homes at night, have caused several housefires in which families have lost everything they had. This grim reality led to the creation of Pisco de Luz, with the sole purpose of bringing a little light into the darkness.</p>

### July 2017
<p>In July 2017, André had his first experience spending the night in the community,  using only diesel oil lamps. Diesel-burning smoke had already made the environment unbearable only two hours after sunset. It felt like being trapped in a garage with cars running. The worst is that his nostrils were full of soot the next day.</p>
<p>Shocked by the severity of the situation and determined to change it, André developed a low-cost solar-powered lighting system to provide sustainable and free light in people's homes. The first prototype was made on a protoboard, and once the circuit was stabilized, he implemented the first version on a universal board.</p>

### August 2017
<p>André installed this first prototype in his house and when he saw that it worked quite well, he developed the first single sided PCB and assembled 2 kits.</p>

### September 2017
<p>In September 2017, after developing and assembling this kits, André returned to this community and installed them in two families. Since it was the first version of the kit, the installation process was quite demanding.</p>

<p>The cable system was composed of a four-color alarm cable connected using jelly crimp wire connectors. It worked well when André first tested this configuration in his at-home laboratory. However, when he went to install the kits in these first two houses, as they were very dark inside, it was pretty challenging to join them correctly.</p>

<p>The first LED switches and modules were very rudimentary and homemade.</p>

<p>After installing the solar panel, LED modules and switches in all the rooms, André went for a delicious swim in the river near the house. 

It is priceless to see their happiness as they sit down to dinner for the first time without oil lamps.</p>

<p>
As night fell, the homeowners, Waldy and Mira, could not believe they finally had light in their home.<br>With tears in her eyes, Mira said, "André, you have fulfilled my life's dream". 

After this moment, seeing the transformation that this simple kit made in their lives, André realized that he could not stop this project. 

### October 2017
<p>A month later, André returned to the community to see if the system was working normally.</p>
<p>The journey there is not easy, about 300 km of paved road and 100 km of adventure. The only way to get there is with a 4x4 vehicle adapted for river crossings and a lot of courage. 

It is common during the rainy season from October to March that the rivers fill up and we have to camp on the road.</p>

The intelligent system monitors many variables, such as the usage hours of illumination, the amount of solar radiation, the minimum and maximum voltage of the battery, etc., delivered through the serial RS232 port.</p>

<p>Everything worked as planned and even though it was the rainy season, the kit was able to light the houses every night. 
Mira and Waldy's house became a meeting place for neighbors and friends to talk at night without the smoke of oil lamps.

Dozens of neighbors also wanted a kit, and André realized it would take years to help them on his own.</p>

### November and December of 2017

<p>
With the photos and recordings from the October visit, André received support from some of his closest friends. In November and December, he managed to assemble more kits and returned to the community, now supported by friends, to help more families.</p>

<p>Approximately 1/6 of the world's population does not have access to electricity, and in Brazil alone there are more than 1 million families in this situation. 

To keep the cost of the solution as low as possible, the goal was not to try to bring the same quality of light that we have in our homes. An oil lamp provides about 15 lumens and this solution provides about 100 lumens. For them, this is many times better and without the toxic smoke produced by oil lamps. But when we compare it to the lighting we have in our homes, >2000 lumens, it seems much inferior.
