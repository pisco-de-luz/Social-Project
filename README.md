# Welcome to the Pisco de Luz Social Project page!

<p>Imagine total darkness. Most of us can’t. We have lived in a world where power runs through everything - our devices, homes, and lives. However, for generations, residents of the Quilombola community in the region of Chapada dos Veadeiros had no access to electricity, condemning them to live in debilitating darkness every night. Living without power severely limits their productivity as well as social interactions. It also exposes them to life-threatening risks, such as animal attacks and hazardous fumes from diesel oil lamps. These lamps, which they use to illuminate their homes at night, have caused several housefires in which families have lost everything they had. This grim reality of the residents’ lives led to the creation of Pisco de Luz, with one purpose - to provide a little light in the darkness.</p>

<p>In July 2017, André had his first experience spending the night in the community,  using only diesel oil lamps. Only two hours after sunset, diesel-burning smoke had already made the environment unbearable. It felt like being trapped in a garage with cars running. The worst is that his nostrils were full of soot the next day.</p>
<p>Shocked at the severity of the situation and determined to change it, André developed a low-cost solar-powered lighting system to provide sustainable and no-cost light in people’s homes. The solar kits consist of wires, LED lamps, a solar panel, and an intelligent controller using an Arduino Nano.</p>

<p>The intelligent system monitors many variables, such as the usage hours of illumination, the amount of solar radiation, the minimum and maximum voltage of the battery, etc., delivered through the serial RS232 port.</p>

<p>In September 2017, after developing and assembling two kits, André returned to this community and installed them in two families. Since it was the first version of the kit, the installation process was quite demanding.</p>

<p>The cable system was composed of a four-color alarm cable connected using jelly crimp wire connectors. It worked well when André first tested this configuration in his at-home laboratory. However, when he went to install the kits in these first two houses, as they were very dark inside, it was pretty challenging to join them correctly.</p>

Pisco de Luz assembles and installs solar-powered light kits in low-income communities with the help of volunteers.

# Bringing Dignity

We transform the lives of families who still live without access to electricity. 

# How?

We install a small solar panel on the roof, an intelligent circuit, a battery, various lights, and light switches throughout the homes.
