# Welcome to the Pisco de Luz Social Project page!

<p>Imagine total darkness. Most of us can’t. We have lived in a world where power runs through everything - our devices, homes, and lives. However, for generations, residents of the Quilombola community in the region of Chapada dos Veadeiros had no access to electricity, condemning them to live in debilitating darkness every night. Living without power severely limits their productivity as well as social interactions. It also exposes them to life-threatening risks, such as animal attacks and hazardous fumes from diesel oil lamps. These lamps, which they use to illuminate their homes at night, have caused several housefires in which families have lost everything they had. This grim reality of the residents’ lives led to the creation of Pisco de Luz, with one purpose - to provide a little light in the darkness.</p>

<p>In July of 2017, André had his first experience spending a night using only diesel oil lamps. Close to 8 o'clock in the night, he remembers that the smoke from diesel burning had already made the environment unbearable. The impression was of being in a closed garage with the car running. The next day, your nostrils dawned full of soot.</p>
<p>Confronted with this scenario, André developed a low-cost solar-powered lighting system to install in their homes. The solar kits consist of wires, LED lamps, a solar panel, and an intelligent controller using an Arduino Nano.</p>

<p>The system also allows monitoring of many variables like how many hours of illumination were used, solar radiation per day, the minimum and maximum voltage of the battery, etc. Everything through the serial port.</p>

<p>In September of 2017, after developing and assembling two kits, André returned to this community and installed them by himself in two families. In this first version of the kit, the installation process was quite demanding.</p>
<p>The cable system was composed of a four-color alarm cable connected using jelly crimp wire connectors. André tested this approach in his house, and it works pretty well. However, when he went to install the kits in these first two houses, as they were very dark inside, it was challenging to see the colors to join them correctly.</p>

Pisco de Luz assembles and installs solar-powered light kits in low-income communities with the help of volunteers.

# Bringing Dignity

We transform the lives of families who still live without access to electricity. 

# How?

We install a small solar panel on the roof, an intelligent circuit, a battery, various lights, and light switches throughout the homes.
