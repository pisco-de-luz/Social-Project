# Why we need your help

First of all, thank you for your interest in helping us and for coming to this site. 

Our work is not easy and without the help of our partners and volunteers we wouldn't have gotten this far. 

When we look through our prism, installing a small solar panel on the roof and putting in a kit to light this house seems like a very simple task.

However, when we talk about families that live in total isolation, often with their nearest neighbor several tens of kilometers away, the situation is very complicated. Often it is not possible to carry ladders and we have to provide one made of material found in nature.

Many homes can only be reached on foot or by horse. Boats or cars cannot always get close, and it is common to have to travel long distances at night and sometimes in the pouring rain.

Because of these difficulties, we need to train some local people to follow up on new installations and leave extra tools and components for them to use for any future maintenance that may be required.

As it is virtually impossible to replace or repair any equipment in these remote regions, it is essential that they are reliable, robust and able to withstand extremely harsh environments. 

For this reason, we are always looking for partners who can help us by providing the materials and services listed below;

* Electronic components
* Lithium batteries
* Telephone cables and RJ11 plugs/adapters
* Headlamps
* Tools like RJ11 crimper, upholsterer's stapler, philips screwdriver, etc.
* Good cameras for night photography
* Drone
* Audio Equipment for Interviews
* Camping accessories
* Car parts like Tires, Lighting kits, portable fuel tanks, etc.
* Test and evaluation consulting for the robustness of our product
* Electronic PCB manufacturing
* PCB Assembly
* Consulting in Software Reliability
